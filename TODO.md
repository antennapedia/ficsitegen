# TODO

* Fix major bugs in date handling for the mongoid version. Timezone problems?
* Write a second set of sample templates. Generalize as needed.
* Naming & code formatting consistency.
* Clean up some data-specific hacks still present. (E.g., tag massaging for external bookmarks file generation.)
* Consider that web application for data input.
* Better organization for epub files.
* PDF generation?
* Handle multiple authors?

## DONE

* Fix yaml input parsing so all three ORMs can read the same input files. (Just naming the yaml classes something other than the model classes will work.)
* Find some way of handling code duplication issues in the various model classes.
* Pull configuration out into an external file.
